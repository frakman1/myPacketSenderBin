# myPacketSenderBin
Linux 32-bit binary for [PacketSender](https://github.com/dannagle/PacketSender)

This came about from the fact that PacketSender is not compiled for Linx 32-bit machines because the latest version of Qt no longer supports it. Running an older version of PacketSender works with Qt5.5. See [this issue](qt-unified-linux-x86-2.0.5-2-online.run.zip) for history/details.

- Unzip the installer file `qt-unified-linux-x86-2.0.5-2-online.run.zip` and run it in on your Linux Desktop (it's a GUI app)
- Unzip PacketSender and run it.
